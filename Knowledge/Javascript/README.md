# Javascript

Some call it the end...   
Some call it the begining...

This is a small project that explores what javascript is and how to use it

## Why 
It has some great communitites, lots of stack overflow coverage, and pretty much any micro-functionality you can think of available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)  
It's a good platform for event based coding  
Dependency management is pretty alright

## More background
JavaScript, often abbreviated to JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.

It's also a great platform to code on your computer using [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Some call it a programming language but it's really more of a specification since there are a few falvors of javscript, and a few different engines tha injest javascript in different ways. 

There are also several ways to organize or "package" javascript code. 

The ES module format is the official standard format to package JavaScript code for reuse and most modern web browsers natively support the modules.

Node.js, however, supports the CommonJS module format by default. CommonJS modules load using require(), and variables and functions export from a CommonJS module with module.exports.

The ES module format was introduced in Node.js v8.5.0 as the JavaScript module system was standardized. Being an experimental module, the --experimental-modules flag was required to successfully run an ES module in a Node.js environment.

However, starting with version 13.2.0, Node.js has stable support of ES modules.
