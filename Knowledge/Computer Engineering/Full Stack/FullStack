How to make a full stack website in 30 minutes or less

# Whats full-stack?
	Usually Full-stack means that you'll have a service,database, 
api and a website, but its definition is "Full-stack refers to a group
of programming languages and tools a developer learns to handle both the
front-end and back-end development of a website"
	
Today we'll ignore the database part...
We'll make a website that will respond with an image when you search in
words.

service -> iterface -> website

# More insight
the service will live on our computer
the interface will live on our computer
the website will live on someone elses computer

Services can be running or instantiated on demand (like a thread).
Either way, it may take time for the service to be ready to return
its information. We account for this by assigning an indentifier 
to the thread. We give that identifier to the website so it can be 
periodically check in on the status of the thread.

Flow in our project:
1. website search -> iterface -> starts python thread
2. interface thread ID -> website
3. Web LOOP: website checks on thread with ID -> iterface
	If interface tells website the threads not done
	    websites waits a bit, then goes back to LOOP
	Else:
		Website uses the data from the interface

# Picking Frameworks - should allow you to speedly develop human readable code
For the service we'll use instantiated python threads
For the interface well use express
For the website we'll use the vue3 framework, vite to develop, and express
to serve it 

# Comunication 
How will communicate with the next?
I like to define a standardized JSON for each communication becuase
it's self documenting

# Implementation

## Service
We'll use #requests to search google for the top image
We'll use #BeautifulSoup to parse out the top image url
We'll use #JSON to send the results in json

## Interface
We'll use #express to serve url routes
We'll use #spawn to spawn pthon threads
We'll use #cors to allow cross website requests, which is disabled by default

## Website
We'll use the #vue3 framework to speedly develop human readable reusable code
We'll use #vite to setup, test, and build our code
We'll use #express to serve the built website
