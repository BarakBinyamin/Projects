This is a short series discussing what I believe to some key take aways from my time studying computer engineering. 

Directory: 
1. What is a computer?
2. What is logic?




RIT order of coarses:

comp sci 1 (python3, intro to coding)
digital systems design 1 ( basic digital circuits with chips)
calculus 1

comp sci 2 (java, intro to object oriented coding)
digital systems design 2 ( design the logic for a mips processor on an FPGA)
calculus
discrete math
physics 1 

embeded systems - (C for micro controllers)
software engineering practices - design planning and priciples
calculus 2
linear & differential equations (systems of linear equations, non-linear systems)
physics 2

applied c (depth into c for x86, performance principles, & leveraging a compiler)
computer architecture (performance oriented systems of logic)
calculus 3 
digital systems design - (logic at the circuit level, hardware constraints and propogation delay)
